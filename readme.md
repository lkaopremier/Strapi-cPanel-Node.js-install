## Documentation Contribution Requirements

The following are required if you are submitting pull requests to the documentation. For more information on how to contribute please see our [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

- NodeJS >=12.x <=14.x
- NPM >= 6.x
- Yarn >= 1.22.x

## Installation

1: Create and configure your application node.js on the cPanel.
2: Load your Strapi project on your node.
3: Add this line to the .env

```sh
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
+ PUBLIC_URL=https://my.domain.com
```

4: Add these lines to .htaccess:

```sh
+ RewriteEngine On
+ RewriteRule ^$ http://localhost:1337/ [P]
+ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
+ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
+ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://localhost:1337/$1 [P]
```

5: Launch your app: enjoy ðŸŽ‰ 

> Look out: If the process stops your application will stop working. You must therefore run the application in the background to allow it to continue working. So you can use `pm2` to keep the process running in the background.

## Configuring `pm2`
1: Install pm2

```sh
npm install -g pm2
```

2: Create a startup file call `start.sh`, with the contents of your script.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/project
npm start
```

3: Then, start `start.sh` by `pm2`.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
pm2 start start.sh --name appNameYouLike
```
